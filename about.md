Hi! I'm Abhijit Nathwani. An engineer, and a technology enthusiast.

### More Information


I'll try and blog about certain topics which I had difficulty in collecting the information online. The blog posts here would be curated from bits and pieces of information found on a topic from the internet, arranged and explained as needed. A believer in Open Source Community, blogs would be my way of returning to the community through posts that explain some topic. I wouldn't be restricting to technology or certain frameworks. I intend to talk about anything and everything that I learned the hard way!

Feel free to engage in discussions using the Disqus comments and let me know of suggestions for the blog posts.
